# Roadmap.sh Project: Single-Page HTML CV
This is a project from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) that I'm creating to improve my skills in HTML. I'm currently following the Front-End Development map, so it's good to practice some good HTML code. It's the foundation of programming! :)
So enjoy and give me feedback if you want!
